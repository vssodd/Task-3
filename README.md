This task contains Python scripts demonstrating the use of conditional statements (if, else) to make decisions based on user input. The examples include:

Simple games (dice roll comparison),

Checking if worked hours cover expenses,

Determining if a number is even or odd,

Applying discounts based on total cost,

Finding the maximum of three numbers,

Responding to weather input (rain or no rain).

These scripts illustrate fundamental decision-making skills in Python and help build a solid foundation in control flow.
